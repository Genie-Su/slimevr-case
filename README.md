Hello everybody.

This repository is related to the open source SlimeVR project.

In the 3D model folder you will find the case model in 3 files.

The case is designed to fit the next components:
- A li-ion battery 804040, 1800mAh
- A computer board D1 mini v.4
- An Adafruit BNO085 board (gyroscope)
- A HW-373 v1.20 charging board

The case size (mm) is 25h x 56w x 44d  

Everything is designed with high precision for the main purpose of the compact case. Ensure you have high resolution 3D printer fo r the best result.

Good luck!
